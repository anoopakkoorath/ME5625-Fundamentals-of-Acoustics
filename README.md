Phase 3: Get the "Magic Links"

You now need to convert the GitHub links into Colab links so students can run them.

    Click on one of the files you just uploaded in the file list (e.g., Lecture1.ipynb).

    Copy the URL from your browser's address bar. It will look like this:
    https://github.com/YourUsername/ME5625-Acoustics-Codes/blob/main/Lecture1.ipynb

    The Modification: Change the beginning of the URL.

        Replace: https://github.com

        With: https://colab.research.google.com/github

    Your new link will look like this:
    https://colab.research.google.com/github/YourUsername/ME5625-Acoustics-Codes/blob/main/Lecture1.ipynb
    (Save this link for the next step).
